//! (NOTE: this endpoint is under development and WILL change without notice. Don't use it until it is moved out of `unspecced` or your application WILL break) Get additional posts under a thread e.g. replies hidden by threadgate. Based on an anchor post at any depth of the tree, returns top-level replies below that anchor. It does not include ancestors nor the anchor itself. This should be called after exhausting `app.bsky.unspecced.getPostThreadV2`. Does not require auth, but additional metadata and filtering will be applied for authed requests.
